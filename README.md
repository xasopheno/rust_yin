A language for binaural, microtonal composition built in Rust.

<em>Make cool sounds. Impress your friends/pets/plants.</em>

**WereSoCool** is a cross-platform programming language for composing microtonal music geometrically. This language doesn't require familiarity with either microtonal music or computer programming, but experience with either will certainly help. 

## Documentation:
If you want to learn how to make cool sounds using WereSoCool, you'll find cool documentation at [weresocool.org](https://www.weresocool.org/tutorials/welcome).
On a desktop computer, you can play with the language in a Firefox or Chrome browser. 
On mobile, you can still view the tutorials, but you won't be able to hear anything.

My recommended approach to learning the language is to do the tutorials in order and write your own composition after completing each one. I'm currently working on additional documentation as well as a record I've made using WereSoCool featuring a great band. Stay tuned. 

## Installation:

### From Source:
You'll need cargo and optionally Just.

Rust: Cargo is the rust package manager for Rust. Install cargo by installing [Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).

You can install from this source code by cloning this repo and then running:

1) If you have `just` installed, run `just install`
    - Just is a command runner. Learn how to install just [here](https://github.com/casey/just).

2) Or run `cargo install --path .` from the root of the repo.

### Macos:

`brew tap xasopheno/weresocool && brew install weresocool`

### Arch Linux:

Available on the AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/weresocool).

### Cargo:

WereSoCool can be installed on macos, linux, and windows via cargo. You'll also need to install the system dependancies listed in the development section. 

 Install cargo by installing [Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).

`cargo install weresocool`

### Windows

This software runs on Windows, but in a slightly limited capacity. On Windows, this software is compiled without mp3 and oggvorbis support. I mostly work on macos and linux machines, so I feel a bit out of my depths in Windows land. If you'd like to help work on the Windows implementation, please reach out. 

You can install WereSoCool from source or via cargo. See above.

Just: Commands are issued via [Just](https://github.com/casey/just).

You'll need also need to install the following packages:

#### Macos:
`brew install lame libvorbis`

##### Arch Linux:
`sudo pacman -S lame vorbis-tools`

##### Ubuntu:
`sudo apt-get lame libmp3lame-dev rpm libasound2-dev vorbis-tools`

### Build
`just build`

## Run Tests:
`just test`

## Special Thanks:
This wouldn't exist in a million years if it wasn't for Antonis Stampoulis'
help with language design or the help of friends/programmers like
SÃ¶nke Hahn, Hao Lian, Catharine M, Matt Handler, Lee Pender, Amanda Doucette, Khaled Alquaddoomi, Alex Kestner, everyone else that has sat down to program with me.
Of course, special thanks to Maria for always listening to my new_weird_sounds
and programming problems. - Danny
