## Special Thanks:
This wouldn't exist in a million years if it wasn't for Antonis Stampoulis'
help with language design or the help of friends/programmers like
SÃ¶nke Hahn, Hao Lian, Catharine M, Matt Handler, Lee Pender, Amanda Doucette, Khaled Alquaddoomi,
Alex Kestner, everyone else that has sat down to program with me.
Of course, special thanks to Maria for always listening to my new_weird_sounds
and programming problems. - Danny
